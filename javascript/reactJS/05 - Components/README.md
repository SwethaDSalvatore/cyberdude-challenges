## Project Title

Components

## Description

This project aims to replicate Bootstrap components (Alert, Accordion, and Button) using Tailwind CSS. It provides a way for developers familiar with Bootstrap to explore the equivalent components in Tailwind CSS. The cloned components are designed to closely resemble their Bootstrap counterparts in appearance and functionality.

## Demo

1. **Alert Component**: Similar to Bootstrap's alert component, it provides various contextual styles for alert messages.
2. **Accordion Component**: Mimics Bootstrap's accordion component, allowing users to collapse and expand content sections.
3. **Button Component**: Replicates Bootstrap's button component with various sizes, styles, and states.

## Technologies Used

- Tailwind CSS
